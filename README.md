# Multiclass-classification-of-Lung-diseases-using-Deep learning
In recent times we have been made aware of the high infection rate and lethality
that can be caused by the outbreak of pulmonary diseases like Covid-19. The need
for an economical and quick diagnosis of such a disease is also increasing. It is
important to consider that a disease like covid has a resemblance to some of the
other pulmonary diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis and has overlapping
symptoms and characteristics with them. There have been many previous types
of research that have used chest x-rays for the classification of covid and healthy
cases or covid and pneumonia or covid and TB using binary classification. This
research proposes a deep learning framework for multiclass classification of Covid-
19, pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and normal cases with the use of chest X-rays. In this
research, I have used a combination of three open datasets available on Kaggle to
create my dataset for research which has a total of 4136 images. I have used image
data augmentation and applied pre-trained models like VGG16 and DenseNet121.
I have also created a CNN from scratch which can perform classification with 91
per cent overall accuracy and high precision and an F1 score which I have discussed
further in the report. This investigation can help physicians and patients in early
diagnosis and can act as a pre-diagnosis method to start early treatment or isolation
of the patient. It can also act as a patient prioritization tool to help physicians
focus on people that have a high probability to be infected in case of a high number
of patients due to a sudden outbreak.
